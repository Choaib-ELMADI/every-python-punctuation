# Every Punctuation in Python

- **_Backtick_** <code style="white-space: pre;"> `&nbsp; </code>: Doesn't do anything in Python.

<br>

- _*Tilde*_ <code style="white-space: pre;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;~&nbsp;&nbsp; </code>: Bitwise not operator.

```python
x = 100
print(~x)
>> -101
```

<br>

<br>

- _*Exclamation*_ `!`: Doesn't do anything on it's own. Combining it with `=` makes the not equality operator.

```python
x = 4
if x != 5:
    print("x is not equal to 5")
```
